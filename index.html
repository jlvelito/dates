                        <p>The beauty of the online dating profile is the power of the delete button! When you meet someone face-to-face with no prior introduction there is no way to rewind and take back that inappropriate comment that leaves you cringing, but on the online dating scene you have the opportunity to tailor and optimise that first impression with the power of the delete button.So be don’t be daunted by the profile section, just take your time and relax!</p>

                <h3>Choosing a Picture</h3>
                <p>So you have written your profile, now you need to choose a picture that will bring everything together. It is okay if you haven’t got any suitable photos, go out and arrange with a friend to have a photo shoot session. You have spent a lot of time and effort on your profile so far, so you deserve to have the best picture possible to complement it. When taking a photo a great time to do this is at dusk or dawn, the light is soft and flattering and you won’t have to use the flash (DON’T use the flash anyway, it is never flattering!).</p>

                    <p>You have your answers to your questions, now you have to decide whether you are going to take it that one step further and go for the date! The most important thing to remember is, don’t go on a date just for the sake of having a date. If you don’t think the person you are meeting up with is right for you, don’t go! You don’t want to have a bad experience, knocking your confidence and putting you off going on further dates. Trust your instincts and make sure you want to go on the date. It is supposed to be fun!</p>
                    <p>Once you have found someone that you want to get to know better, it’s time to take the conversation off line. This means you’ll have to swap your details. Make sure you give your mobile number rather than your home phone number - this gives less information away about your location, and never give out your address. Receiving letters is romantic sure, but you need to get to know the other person better before you give out personal information like that.</p>

                <p>So you have decided to go for a date (Wohoo!) the next step is to take the communication offline (no more delete button!). Panic not though, start by talking on the phone. This is a great way to lead into the date, it also helps break down the barriers and grease the conversation wheels.</p>

                <h3>Potential Talking Topics and Conversation Starters</h3>
                <p>A quick note to bare in mind whilst talking with your date, you're going to be nervous it is to be expected but make sure you listen to your date’s answers. Most people are so busy thinking about what their next question is going to be they don’t actually listen to the other person’s answer.</p>
                <p>It is good to have a list of questions and conversation starters to combat any potential lulls or awkward silences in the conversation, but listening to the other persons answers could provide the opportunity to ask follow up questions and find mutual interests. It also shows that you are really interested in them and what they have to say, rather than staring blankly and nodding your head (not cool).</p>

                    <h3>How Much <strong>Should i Drink?</strong></h3>
                    <p>There is no hard and fast rule with regards to alcohol however, you can be sure that getting too tipsy or worse will be a complete turn-off, you have to know your limits! We would recommend one glass of wine with the meal, this can add intimacy and romance but won’t cloud your judgement later in the evening. But if you date orders a soft drink and no alcohol it would be best to mirror them and go for a soft drink too.</p>

                <p class="espc">One last thing to watch is the nervous drinking before the date, the one that ‘takes the edge off’. Try and find other ways to calm your nerves, perhaps invite your friends around to help you get ready or look into herbal alternatives.</p>

                    <p>If your first date includes a meal then this offers a very natural ending however, if there is no obvious ending then it is wise to inform your date that you have another commitment the next day/after the date and give them a rough time.  This will give you an out if you require it.</p>

                    <p>By the end of the date you should hopefully have a better idea if you want to have a second date.</p>

                        <li><img src="assets/images/dont01.jpg" alt=""/> <h4>Don't</h4> <p>If you do not want a second date, for whatever reason, then don’t leave them hanging on, it is unfair to keep their hopes up.</p></li>

                    <h3>To Kiss or Not To Kiss?</h3>
                    <p>If the date went well and you are hoping for a second date, pay close attention to your date’s body language, not everyone feels comfortable going for the kiss after the first date. It is best to go into the date with the expectations of a hug at the end, and adjust these accordingly depending on your date’s body language. Maybe a kiss on the cheek is appropriate, but if the chemistry is there and you both want it, keep the kiss short and sweet, leave them wanting more!</p>
                    <p>Best of luck with your dating, be true to yourself, do this for
                    yourself and not for anyone else.</p>
